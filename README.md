# DepositContract

General purpose contract for depositing ETH with multi-purpose applications.

The contract is a simple ETH depository, like a savings bank. Users deposit their ETH to the contract.

Only users can withdraw their deposit, while the contract owner can withdraw the total balance.

This is by design, since the deposit contract can be used for the following applications:

- Crowd Funding
- Solications
- Donations
- Goodwill
- General Payment Collection

The contract owner can be the one responsible for collecting deposits.
